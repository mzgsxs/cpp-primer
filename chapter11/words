Like the sequential containers, the associative containers are templates (ยง 3.3, p. 96). To define a map, we must specify both the key and value types. In this program, the map stores elements in which the keys are strings and the values are size_ts (ยง 3.5.2, p. 116). When we subscript word_count, we use a string as the subscript, and we get back the size_tcounter associated with that string.
